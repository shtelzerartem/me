          I co-founded homemade analytics and BI agency, specializing in data warehousing and analytics :)
          <br />
          With expertise in NodeJS, Python, Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, App Engine, BigQuery, and Supermetrics, we developed
          custom ETL processes and architected data warehouses to help companies like Verbit, Easy2Give, Terrific Digital,
          atomi, and Vyzer extract insights from their data.

        <Experience jobName="Soyuzgruz" period="2019 Jan - 2020 Aug">
          I helped to build a cargo transportation startup, kind of like Uber for cargo. As a developer, I designed and
          implemented new features that made the experience awesome for both drivers and clients. Later, I became the
          lead frontend developer managing work on three of our projects: a web app, a driver app, and a client app.
          They were all a huge success and helped the company grow fast!
